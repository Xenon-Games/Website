<p>Paradigm Zero is a first-person, story-driven, dystopian-future. A player takes on the identity of Charlie, a young man in the semi-near future. He embarks on a bold journey to discover the forgotten past, and free humanity from mechanical rulers. Via detailed story-telling and exciting combat, the player experiences a beautifully-broken world, and its plagues.

    Humans long ago worked to find new life.  They searched every shred of their own planet, before looking to the stars.  When the stars looked empty, they created conscious machines. There was only a very short time in which the humans maintained control.  Soon, the inevitable happened - but the effects were unclear. The machines duplicated, reproduced and spread. No one knew how they would treat humanity.  Would they be a close ally or an extinction-level-threat? The humans told the machine that they wanted to be allies, and help the world. To the machines, helping the world meant destroying humanity.
    
    ​
    
    The Ultimate goal is to return power to the captive humans and free the enslaved by destroying the AI regime.

    Our game will mimic this problem by incorporating two groups of humans with opposite ideas. One will feel it is too risky to rebel against the robots, and as a result they are subservient to the machines. The other group of humans feel the reward is greater than the risk, and take it upon themselves to single handedly otherthrow their oppressors.
    
    ​
    
    This will be replicated in our game by cameras in every room. These cameras are run by an AI that monitors every frame. This would cause any actions that are considered “rebellious”. People would constantly be worried about what the cameras are seeing of their actions. In addition to these cameras indoors, there will be surveillance drones that monitor every move outside.

    In Paradigm Zero, the player learns that the AI is created my humanity, so in a cruel twist of fate, humanity is its own worst enemy and its own downfall.</p>
